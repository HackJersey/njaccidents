# njaccidents
Makefile for combining NJ [accident data](http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/accident/) from the state Department of Transportation into one massive CSV. Currently this only grabs data from one of five tables. It does not handle the driver, vehicle, pedestrian or occupant tables.
