# njaccidents
Makefile for combining NJ [accident data](http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/accident/) from the state Department of Transportation into one massive CSV. Currently this only grabs data from the accident tables for 2008-2014. It does not handle the driver, vehicle, pedestrian or occupant tables.
